# Super Mario Bros Remastered Sprite Viewer
A sprite viewer for SMB1R! I did this mostly as a coding exercise.
You can play it here: https://github.com/JHDev2006/Super-Mario-Bros.-Remastered-Public/
# How to use
## Adding a spritesheet
Simply press alt and then select either the .png or .json of the spritesheet you want to view (they must have the same name)!
## Controls
J/L - scroll through animations
W/S - change between backgrounds
K - toggle dropshadow
## How to add backgrounds (for viewing)
Add a png file in the themes folder and either start the file name with "dark_" or "light_"
This is so the text can either be black or white
You can also add "_uncolored" to the end of the filename to keep the color from being rainbow.
